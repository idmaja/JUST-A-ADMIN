## Getting Started

# Next.js Movie/Anime List Project

This is a Next.js project for listing movies and anime, utilizing the [Jikan API](https://api.jikan.moe/v4) for data retrieval. The project uses MongoDB as its database and Prisma as the ORM. Before running the project, ensure you initialize the environment variables.

## Features

- List movies and anime fetched from the Jikan API.
- MongoDB for database management.
- Prisma for ORM.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idmaja/JUST-A-ADMIN.git
cd JUST-A
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Initialize Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = <your_nextauth_secret>

NEXTAUTH_URL= http://localhost:3001

DATABASE_URL= <your_mongodb_url>
```

### 4. Prisma Setup

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Run Prisma migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Running the Development Server

```bash
$env:PORT=3001; npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, to start the production server, run:

```bash
 npm run dev
```
